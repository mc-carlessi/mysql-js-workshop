# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Customer’s data is the most important IP, preserve it’s integrity and be able to restore in case of accident is a mandatory activity.
Data recovery is needed in many situations: recover from disaster, fix a human mistake, create HA or DR sites, retention for regulations, etc. And different needs require different tools.
Join us at this hands-on workshop to learn how MySQL EE backup can protect your customer's data.
